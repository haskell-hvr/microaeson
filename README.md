# microaeson: A tiny JSON library with light dependency footprint

`microaeson` aims to provide a [RFC 8259](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259)
compliant JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) implementation.

The [microaeson](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/microaeson) package provides
a smaller subset of the [aeson](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson) API
with less dependencies and a simpler implementation.

The API is designed in such a way to allow to easily convert client
code written against `microaeson`'s API to use the full
[aeson](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson) API.
